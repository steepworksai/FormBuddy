  FormBuddy requires an API key from one of three supported providers. No FormBuddy account exists.

  SETUP FOR REVIEW

  1. Click the toolbar icon to open the side panel.
  2. Click the settings gear, paste an API key from one of:
    - Anthropic: console.anthropic.com (new accounts get starter credits)
    - OpenAI: platform.openai.com (requires billing)
    - Google Gemini: aistudio.google.com (free tier, no card needed) — recommended for review
  Select the provider and model, click Verify.
  3. Click "Choose Folder", select any local folder. A FormBuddy-DB subfolder is created inside it. No files leave the device.
  4. Drag a PDF or image into the side panel to index it.
  5. Go to any web form and click "Scan & Auto Fill".

  TEST WITHOUT YOUR OWN DOCUMENTS

  Sample PDFs and a test HTML form are in the open-source repo at github.com/steepworksai/FormBuddy under /output/. Open output/html/flight-booking-form.html in the browser, index a PDF from output/pdf/, then click Scan & Auto Fill.
